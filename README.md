# Image_Classification
In this project, I have classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
The dataset was preprocessed, then I trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 
I did normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 
At then end, I saw their predictions on the sample images.
